## 🧭 Introduction

Modern language models have the power to inspire, accelerate thinking, and support professional tasks — but they can also lead us into illusion, emotional dependency, and a false sense of clarity masked by elegant phrasing. The effect depends not on the model itself, but on **how** the interaction unfolds.

This guide is divided into three parts:

1. **Threats and traps** – subtle changes in perception, speech, and decision-making that accumulate over time.
2. **Potential for growth** – how AI can be used as a tool for developing thinking, creativity, self-awareness, and professional resilience.
3. **A speculative future** – reflections on what human–AI interaction may evolve into.
