## Appendix B. Examples of Mature Interaction Habits

### 1️⃣ 🛠 If the model doesn’t understand the request the first time (20–30 prompts) → analyze why
- Where was the ambiguity in the question?  
- What information was missing?  
- Would an example or context have helped?  
- Where was the lack of specificity?  
- What could I have clarified in the question?  
- Can I try to formulate the conclusion myself?  

📌 **Result:** improves task formulation skills and increases precision of thinking.

### 2️⃣ 📘 If the conversation was deep and rich → pause, review, summarize
- What key ideas did I understand?  
- What from this do I want to preserve in my knowledge system?  
- How could this be applied in the future?  

📌 **Result:** strengthens the ability to capture meaning and build intellectual maps.

### 3️⃣ 🧩 If the topic has “spread out” and gone too wide → ask yourself: what one idea do I take as central?
- What was the core thought?  
- What was secondary but important?  
- How can I phrase it in one sentence?  

📌 **Result:** enhances the skill of meaningful summarization and focus management.
