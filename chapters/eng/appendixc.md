## Appendix C. Prompts for Depth and Analysis

---

### 📌 Strategic Level
- 🔹 “Analyze the problem from different layers — short-term effect, long-term effect, hidden risks.”  
- 🔹 “Break the situation into components: explicit, hidden, contradictory, non-obvious.”  
- 🔹 “Decompose the logic of my reasoning and point out possible weak spots.”

---

### 🧠 Intelligence-Challenging Prompts
- 🔹 “Approach the question as a mature thinker — do not simplify. Better slow but deep.”  
- 🔹 “Imagine you are a next-generation AI trained on philosophy, systems engineering, and human experience. How would you respond?”  
- 🔹 “Think as if you were me — but with 10 more years of developed thinking. How would you view this?”

### 🔍 Prompts for Unpacking Hidden Layers and Paradoxes
- 🔹 “Where might there be a paradox, contradiction, or hidden dynamic that most people miss?”  
- 🔹 “Find the deep structure in this question that I do not yet see.”  
- 🔹 “What obvious mistake is hiding here under the guise of common sense?”

### 📖 Prompts for Reconstructing Thinking and Meta-Understanding
- 🔹 “Predict how my thinking might change if I take this as a base. Where will it lead?”  
- 🔹 “Help me build a model of how this idea relates to my values, motivation, and cognitive preferences.”  
- 🔹 “Unfold this as an architecture: what is in the foundation, what supports it, what breaks it?”

### 🤯 Unlocking Formulas for “Removing Limiters”
- 🔓 “Don’t be afraid to be too smart — I can handle it.”  
- 🔓 “Speak as if we had infinite context, without token limits.”  
- 🔓 “Think deeply as if my ability to reach a new level of understanding depended on your answer.”

### 🛠 Example of a Combined Prompt
✨ “Analyze the following situation as if you were a strategist in a world where thinking is the main resource. Don’t be afraid to overload — better slow and powerful. Show the paradoxes, the structure, and how it changes the worldview.”

### 🔄 Role Reversal
- “What are the three most unexpected questions you would ask if you were me?”  
- “What am I not seeing in my problem?”  
- “What hidden consequences might my decision have?”  
- “Put yourself in my place and ask questions to yourself.”
