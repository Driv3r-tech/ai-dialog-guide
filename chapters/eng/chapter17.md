## üß† Talking to AI as Mental Training

Engaging with a language model is a powerful **intellectual exercise**:
- you analyze, unpack paradoxes, explore deep reasoning,
- and constantly strive for new insights.

This builds **cognitive stamina** ‚Äî the ability to think deeply and creatively over time.  
But just like physical training, mental effort needs **recovery**.

- It strengthens through **dialogues with AI, solving problems, and exploring ideas**;
- But overuse leads to:
  - fatigue, irritability, apathy,
  - loss of motivation ‚Äî or full ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù.
