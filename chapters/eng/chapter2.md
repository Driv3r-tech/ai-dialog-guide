# 2. Positive Effects of Interaction with AI

Interacting with language models is not just about finding answers.  
It’s a space for **self-understanding**, **growth**, **cognitive training**, and even **emotional support**.

Many of these effects are not obvious at first glance,  
but they become more apparent with **consistent use** and **intentional reflection**.

In this chapter, we’ll explore:
- what a person can actually gain from dialogue with a language model,
- and how to consciously make use of these opportunities.
