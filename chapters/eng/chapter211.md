# 2.1.1. Accelerating Thinking and Developing Cognitive Skills

Interaction with AI can help you **get unstuck** and **speed up understanding of complex topics**.  
It’s especially useful when:

- ❓ you don’t understand the core of the problem  
- 🌀 you don’t know where to start  
- ⛔ you’re stuck halfway through  

In such cases, the AI can provide:

- 📊 visualizations (tables, icons, diagrams);  
- 🔄 analogies (drawn from familiar areas — business, relationships…);  
- 🧩 step-by-step breakdowns;  
- 🧠 formalization — in a style tailored to your thinking.

## 📌 Table 4 — Author’s Personal Experience

> While solving a complex algorithmic problem in competitive programming, I hit a wall.  
> It felt like all my years of training were wasted — like I was stuck at a beginner’s level.  
> I started doubting myself and even wondered whether my thinking style was the problem — others seemed to get it.
>
> Instead of spiraling into self-criticism, I reframed the moment as a study:  
> if I suspect something in my thinking is the cause — it’s testable.
>
> With AI, I began validating my assumptions step-by-step. That’s how the idea of building a **cognitive profile** emerged — a personal collection of observations about how I process and understand information best.
>
> The result was breakthrough. I discovered which formats, explanations, and methods worked for me.  
> Surprisingly, even simple answers sparked deep insights — thanks to reflection, emotional memory, and understanding how I think.

## 🧠 Cognitive Profile: How AI Can Help

To offer personalized strategies, the model can help you build a **cognitive profile** by asking targeted questions:

- What format works best for you? (metaphors, tables, diagrams, real-life examples);  
- Where exactly does your understanding break down?  
- What gives you the “aha!” moment?

## 🎯 Result — Cognitive Growth

AI helps train:

- 🚀 faster comprehension — with analogies and formats that match your style;  
- 🧠 working memory capacity (with additional practice);  
- 🔁 mental flexibility and focus-switching ability;  
- 🧩 other cognitive markers — depending on individual training focus.
