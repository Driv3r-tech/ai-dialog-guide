# 2.1.2. The “Natural NZT” Effect with AI

Working with a language model can trigger a state of accelerated clarity, focus, and awareness —  
a kind of **“natural NZT” effect**, like from the movie *Limitless*.  
But to make this effect **reliable**, not random, you need to master specific techniques and rhythms of interaction.

## 🔹 Special Question Techniques

A question is your **Archimedean lever** — the better it’s shaped, the more it can shift your thinking.  
Here are four techniques for developing **multi-layered thinking**:

| Technique Name             | Essence                                                          | Example Prompt                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clarification via options  | Ask for multiple alternatives, not just one                      | “Show 3 different strategies to solve this, with pros and cons”          |
| Meaning tree expansion     | Ask to unfold the idea in layers: from surface to deep           | “Explain this idea on 3 levels: simple, systemic, and fundamental”       |
| Structural decomposition   | Break down an idea into components                               | “Split this concept into its assumptions and dependencies”               |
| Role-based rethinking      | Ask the AI to respond from different roles or perspectives       | “Respond as an engineer, then a philosopher, then a strategist”          |

## 🔹 Thinking Rhythms

To avoid burnout from accelerated development, it's essential to **alternate thinking modes**:

- **Focused thinking** (deep dive):  
  intense idea work — 45–90 minutes  
- **Diffuse thinking** (relaxed observation):  
  walks, light tasks, rest — 15–30 minutes

💡 Alternating these rhythms helps you:
- strengthen associative links  
- avoid “mental overheating”  
- access **unexpected insights**

➡ This is the basis for **layered awareness**.

## 🔹 Growth Phases

Cognitive growth happens in **waves** — and AI can help you manage them:

| Phase                   | Sign                            | What to Do                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Inspired Growth         | Lots of ideas, high energy       | Create concepts, mind maps                   |
| Fatigue or Chaos        | Overload, loss of clarity        | Switch tasks, organize thoughts              |
| Crystallization Phase   | Clear structure, stable vision   | Write, design, or start execution            |
