# 2.1.6. The “Five Filters” Technique for Evaluating an Idea

Ask the language model to analyze your idea from five distinct perspectives:
- **Entrepreneur** – focuses on profit, scalability, risks, and competition.
- **Scientist** – focuses on evidence, data, methodology, and novelty.
- **Critic** – looks for weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and potential negative outcomes.
- **Dreamer** – seeks bold, unconventional scenarios and visionary perspectives.
- **Pragmatist** – emphasizes practical feasibility, resources, and step-by-step implementation.

Each role views your idea through a unique filter of priorities and experience.  
The goal is not just to receive five reworded answers, but to explore five **fundamentally different ways of thinking**.

## 🔹 Key Requirements for the Prompt

To get valuable results, your prompt should clearly specify:

### 1. Distinct priorities, values, and evaluation criteria
- Don’t just ask to “rephrase” the idea from different roles.
- Instead, instruct:
  - the entrepreneur to focus on profit and growth,  
  - the scientist on methods and evidence,  
  - the critic on weaknesses,  
  - the dreamer on future possibilities,  
  - the pragmatist on practical implementation.

### 2. Deep and non-obvious arguments
- Avoid generic phrases like “this is promising” or “there are risks.”
- Ask for specific, insightful reasoning grounded in logic, experience, and hidden interconnections.

### 3. A clear purpose for the analysis
- Define why you want these perspectives in advance:
  - **Stress-testing** the idea – to see where it breaks under scrutiny.
  - **Discovering new directions** – to explore unexpected angles and expand your concept.

## 💬 Prompt Example

Evaluate my idea from five different perspectives: entrepreneur, scientist, critic, dreamer, and pragmatist. For each role, use distinct priorities, values, and evaluation criteria — don’t just change the tone. Provide deep, non-obvious arguments and avoid generic statements.
Goal – [specify: stress test / explore new directions].
Here is the idea description: [your idea].

## 🔎 Why This Matters

- **Cognitive diversity** – you go beyond your habitual thinking patterns.
- **Early resilience check** – your idea undergoes a simulated “stress test” before facing the real world.
- **Insight generation** – even unusual perspectives may reveal breakthrough solutions.
