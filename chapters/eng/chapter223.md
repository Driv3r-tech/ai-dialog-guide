## 🧭 Strategy: "Retelling a Person’s Life Story"

### 📖 Essence:
Write a retelling of someone's life in your own words — like a rough draft of their biography, based on what you know or have heard.  
Start simply: describe their life from childhood to today in 10–15 sentences.

### ➡️ Then, choose one of three approaches:

- **Self-clarification**:  
  Ask yourself questions to spot gaps, generalizations, or unclear parts.

- **Collaborative development (with a person or AI)**:  
  Ask someone (or an AI) to challenge your draft with follow-up questions to deepen the narrative.

- **Role immersion**:  
  Imagine yourself in their shoes. Answer questions *as if* you were them. This often reveals insights you wouldn't access otherwise.

## ❓ Self-reflection Questions:

1. What do I still know only superficially?  
2. What inner contradictions can I detect?  
3. Which events shaped the key turning points in their life?  
4. What atmosphere of time and place have I conveyed?  
5. What would this person object to if they read my retelling?
