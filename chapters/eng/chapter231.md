# 2.3 Block: Creative Development

# 2.3.1. Monthly Generation of Ideas and Insights

AI can regularly (e.g., once a month or via reminders) bring you back to essential questions:
- Which ideas in recent chats were left unfinished?
- Where does your thinking need refinement?
- What deserves a second look?

## üìå Context From the Author‚Äôs Experience

When I realized that creating a cognitive profile with AI genuinely helped me grow and speed up my thinking, I asked myself:

> **"Can AI suggest other useful techniques I might be missing?"**

In response, the AI suggested that ‚Äî in the future, with more technical capabilities ‚Äî it could give real-time, personalized feedback:
- Highlight where I lose clarity
- Suggest clearer formulations
- Detect weak points in my reasoning

## üìÜ A Simple but Powerful Idea

Since real-time tracking isn‚Äôt yet available, I decided to build a manual workaround:

1. I set a recurring monthly reminder in my calendar.
2. On that day, I open a chat with the AI and ask:

- What ideas have I left underdeveloped recently?
- What parts of my language were unclear?
- How can I ask better questions?
- Where do I repeat myself or shift topics abruptly?

## ü§ñ AI as a Thinking Development Partner

This approach turns the AI into a consistent partner in self-reflection.  
Growth becomes **systematic**, not dependent on motivation alone.

The AI can:
- Show where your thinking lacks precision
- Detect repetitive patterns or logical inconsistencies
- Highlight topic-switching tendencies
- Compare how your questions evolve over time

> Even a simple monthly reminder can transform your AI chats into  
> **a powerful growth cycle**, tailored to your personal style of thinking.
