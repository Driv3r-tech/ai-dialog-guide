# 2.4.1. Reusing Competitive Programming Tasks

If you want to systematically level up your thinking and shift from *managing* projects to *designing* solutions, here’s a simple and powerful algorithm:

1. **Go to [usaco.guide](https://usaco.guide)** – a platform with algorithm and data structure problems (or any similar service).
2. **Pick a topic**, e.g., *Two Pointers*, and ask the AI:  
   *"Hi, explain <topic> to me as a businessperson, using real-world business examples."*  
   – if you don’t understand the topic.
3. **Choose a problem from that topic** (scroll down the page) and ask:  
   *"Now explain the essence of this problem <problem name> from a business perspective."*  
   – if the task description seems unclear.
4. **Describe how you would solve it in plain words**, then ask:  
   *"Here's my algorithm. What are the strengths and weaknesses of my approach from a business-thinker’s and problem-solver’s point of view?"*  
   or  
   *"Please generate code based on the algorithm I describe below. Problem: <problem name>, Input/Output format: <...>. My algorithm: <description>."*
5. **Analyze a strong programmer’s solution** and ask:  
   *"Here’s the code. What techniques does it use? What business insights can we draw from this?"*  
   – if you couldn’t solve the task even with AI hints and modifications.
6. **Repeat with another problem or ask for a summary:**  
   *"Summarize: how can this principle be applied to real-world business scenarios? Give at least one practical use case. And what real-world factors could break this logic?"*  
   – First write down your own insights, then ask for AI feedback.

🧠 This method teaches you to:
- see algorithms as business models,  
- compare different approaches,  
- notice systemic techniques,  
- build strategic thinking.

📌 After each cycle, be sure to ask yourself:  
**"Where in my real-life work could I apply this approach?"**  
This is the key step that turns theory into experience.
