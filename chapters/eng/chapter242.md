## 2.4.2. Developing EQ and Stress Resilience

### Dilemma Launch
The dilemma prompt for the user is:  
*"Hi, please write an example of a real-life dilemma for a <>-year-old <gender>."*

**Options:**
- **Topic:** which areas I enjoy discussing, and which I avoid
- **Complexity:** number of layers, consequences, hidden motives
- **Frequency:** how common or unusual it feels in real life
- **Consciousness:** whether it’s a human or AI in a human body

**Questions to explore:**
1. Surface level
2. Hidden motives
3. Deep paradox
4. Opportunity to observe my reaction to others’ pain and choices

### Method for Developing Emotional Intelligence and Stress Resilience
This method is based on **regular practice** and consists of **three steps**:

#### 1. Identifying the Emotional Profile
📋 Take a test that reveals:
- Topics that spark interest (success, relationships, recognition…)
- Topics that trigger anxiety or tension (loss of control, prison, aggression, rejection…)
- Emotions that are hardest to recognize and endure  

🎯 **Result:** a personal map of EQ vulnerabilities and growth zones → selection of relevant case scenarios.

#### 2. Experiencing 2 Profile-Based Cases
🎭 Receive two dilemmas tailored to your profile. They:
- Evoke emotions  
- Require decision-making  
- Include both moral and strategic layers  

After going through them – conduct **conscious reflection** (written or spoken).

#### 3. Regular Mental Practice
📆 Every 2 weeks (or when resources allow) – take on a new case.  
🧭 Mandatory follow-up:
- Post-case self-observation checklist
- Mini-questions: *“What did I realize?”, “What changed?”, “Where could I apply this?”*

### A. Emotional Profile Details
We create a **structured emotional profile** through the test to:
- Identify topics that bring the most motivation
- Identify topics that cause avoidance or tension (growth keys)
- Determine preferred reaction style and awareness level

### 📋 Emotional Profile Test Structure (Draft)
The test has **three parts** and produces a clear **emotional-motivational fingerprint**.

#### I. Thematic Areas  
(What attracts attention and curiosity)  
❓ Rate from **1** (not interested at all) to **5** (very appealing, want to explore/experience)  

| Topic | Example Questions |
|-------|-------------------|
| Relationships | Are you interested in motives behind people’s actions in conflicts or affairs? |
| Personal Growth | Do you like stories where someone goes through an inner crisis and changes? |
| Success and Power | Are you drawn to dilemmas about career, competition, leadership? |
| Influence and Manipulation | Do you want to understand hidden games, even if they are dark strategies? |
| Heroes and Victims | Are you intrigued by moral choices in risk, rescue, or protection scenarios? |

#### II. Zones of Anxiety / Avoidance  
(What causes discomfort or resistance – but may be a growth point)  
❓ Mark topics that are unpleasant to read, discuss, or experience:  
- 🔻 Conflicts with authority (prison, army, injustice)  
- 🔻 Cruelty, violence, coercion  
- 🔻 Rejection, loneliness, shame  
- 🔻 Loss of control, panic, mistakes under pressure  
- 🔻 Situations where it’s unclear who is right  
- 🔻 Death, illness, guilt  

📌 Important: aim not to avoid → but to enter weak zones gradually.

#### III. Behavioral Style and Awareness Level  
❓ What do you usually do in a morally complex situation?  

| Response | Style |
|----------|-------|
| “I try to figure out who’s right or wrong” | Rational analysis |
| “I instantly feel what I would do – from within” | Intuitive / empath |
| “I avoid – dislike conflict and strong emotions” | Avoidant style |
| “I choose what brings the least harm” | Balanced / protective |
| “I don’t think – just decide” | Fast, automatic choice |

---

✅ **Result:** Emotional Profile
From this, we identify:
- Interest topic (motivation)
- Weak-spot topic (growth area)
- Emotional-reactive style (interaction pattern with cases)
