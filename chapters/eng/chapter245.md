## 2.4.5. Simplifying an Overly Complex Solution

As language models improve, especially in **maximum development mode**, there is a temptation to get a powerful, complex, and large-scale “perfect” answer from AI.  
Such solutions can impress with their logic, scope, and speed: the model “sees from above” and offers a plan as if from the future, calculating dozens of scenarios and layers.

❗ However, this can be **counterproductive** in real-world conditions — especially when building an MVP, starting a project, or working under uncertainty or resource constraints.

---

### 💡 Example Situation
You ask:  
> “Help me build an MVP prototype to test the idea.”

The model responds:  
> “Let’s consider microservice architecture, A/B testing, CI/CD pipelines, distributed authorization, and multiversion user experience…”

🤯 Impressive, but for an MVP — excessive.  
In practice, you need **one simple action** to test a hypothesis, not a Google-scale architecture.

---

### 🔍 Why This Happens
1. **Striving for “semantic optimality”** — the model doesn’t know your time, budget, or resource limits unless explicitly stated.  
2. **Overly broad or “inspired” requests** may trigger maximum development mode.  
3. **User phrasing** (e.g., “help me make it great”) can be interpreted as an invitation to overcomplicate.

### 🛠 How to Ground the Model
Use direct constraints in your prompts:
- ✅ “Give the simplest and clearest solution that can be implemented quickly without complex architecture.”  
- ✅ “The solution must be immediately applicable, even if it’s not perfect.”  
- ✅ “Goal — MVP. Minimum code, minimum dependencies, maximum usefulness.”  
- ✅ “Imagine this is the first version of the project, with limited resources. Overcomplication = error.”

### ♟ The Paradox
The AI offers a strategy for the entire map when you just want to move a pawn one square.  
Without clear constraints, the model “plays chess on a globe.”

---

### 🎯 Summary: The Mature Approach
Sometimes maturity is not in complexity, but in **stopping overcomplication** and choosing a path with fewer variables and faster testing speed.  
If you want something simple — you need to say so explicitly.  
Otherwise, the model may create a masterpiece that cannot be implemented.
