### üìå About terminology

In everyday use, people often refer to systems like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini** .etc as ‚Äúartificial intelligence.‚Äù These are, in fact, **language models** ‚Äî systems that interact with users through natural language.

In this guide, the terms **‚Äúmodel,‚Äù ‚Äúlanguage model (LM),‚Äù** and **‚Äúartificial intelligence (AI)‚Äù** will be used interchangeably, unless a distinction is required by context.

> This guide does not aim for terminological precision. Its goal is to support **mature interaction** with modern language-based AI systems ‚Äî regardless of their internal architecture.
